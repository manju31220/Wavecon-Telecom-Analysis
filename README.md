# Wavecon Telecom Analysis

This Presentation is done as part of the codebaiscs virtual internship program

## Task :

Analyze the dashboard and provide insights on a ppt that addresses the following questions:

- What is the impact of the 5G launch on our revenue?
- Which KPI is underperforming after the 5G launch?
- After the 5G launch, which plans are performing well in terms of revenue? Which plans are not performing well?
- Is there any plan affected largely by the 5G launch? Should we continue or discontinue that plan?
- Is there any plan that is discontinued after the 5G launch? What is the reason for it?

Create a presentation from the dashboard for our telecom client 'wavecon'.

## Insights
- The revenue has experienced a 0.5% decrease compared to the previous network
- Despite a 55% increase in unsubscribed users, Pune has shown an impressive 18% growth in active users.
- Among all the plans, Plan 1, Plan 2, and Plan 11 stand out as the top-performing plans.
- Following the launch of 5G, Plan 5 and Plan 7 have experienced significant failures, particularly Plan 7, which has witnessed a decline in revenue across almost all cities. It would be advisable to discontinue Plan 7 and proceed with the remaining plans.
- WaveCon consistently holds the third position in the market without any fluctuations.

## Recommendations
- Investigate revenue decline in Delhi, Chennai, and other affected cities through customer surveys and competitive analysis. 
- Retain active users in Delhi & Mumbai by improving service quality, offering targeted discounts, and addressing complaints. 
- Analyze high unsubscription in Lucknow to identify dissatisfaction factors and reduce churn. 
- Optimize plan offerings by promoting high-performing plans (P1), revising low-performing ones (P7), and monitoring new plans (P11-P13). 
- Enhance 5G network quality in affected areas and offer exclusive benefits to retain at-risk users.
